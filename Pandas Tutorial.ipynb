    "With Pandas, you can extract data from various files (e.g., CSV) and present it in a DataFrame—a table, essentially—and then work with that data. For example, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What is the average, median, maximum, or minimum of each column?\n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the data by removing missing values and filtering rows or columns based on certain criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the data using Matplotlib. You can create bar charts, line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and much more.\n",

    "- Save the cleaned and transformed data back into a CSV file, another file, or a database\n",

    "NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are known as `libraries`, which are collections of code that provide specific functions and tools. For example, **NumPy** includes various mathematical functions such as sine (numpy.sin(x)) or logarithm (numpy.log(x)).\n",
